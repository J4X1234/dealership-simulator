This Python program simulates a basic car dealership system where users can buy, sell, and paint cars. Each car has its own name, color, and price, and the user manages a virtual bank account to perform transactions. The program features a simple terminal-based menu and supports importing and exporting car inventory data via .txt files.

Key Concepts Used:

Object-Oriented Programming: The Car class (defined separately) encapsulates each vehicle's properties and methods, like painting.

File I/O: Supports reading from and writing to text files to persist the bank balance and inventory.

Control Flow & Logic: Uses conditionals, loops, and user input to drive interactive menu behavior.

Global Variable Management: Tracks and updates the bank account as transactions occur.

Data Simulation: Implements price markup on newly bought cars and real-time updates on selling or modifying them.
